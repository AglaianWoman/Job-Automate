# Job Automate

## Synopsis

jobautomate.py takes input for a job description and a location and searches for jobs
using Indeed.com. The script will only apply to jobs that use the 'Easily Apply' approach.
This allows the script to read from file only the full name, email address, and resume of the
job applicant in order to apply to the job.
