# Job Automate

## Overview

jobautomate.py takes user input for a job description and a location then searches for jobs
using Indeed.com. The script will only apply to jobs that use the 'Easily Apply' approach.
This allows the script to read from file just the name, email address, phone number, cover
letter, and resume of the job applicant in order to apply to the job. 

## Current Status

Currently, the script will only click the first link of the search results regardless of
whether or not the link is an 'Easily Apply' application. Future development will add
functionality to click all links on the page.
