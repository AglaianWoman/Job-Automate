# Job Automate

## Overview

jobautomate.py takes user input for a job description and a location then searches for jobs
using the Indeed API. The script will only apply to jobs that use the 'Easily Apply' approach.
This allows the script to read from file just the name, email address, phone number, cover
letter, and resume of the job applicant in order to apply to the job.

## Current Status

Currently, the script will browse through links and apply to the applications that use
the easily apply approach. Since there are now a lot of variations of the application,
some job applications may need a different approach.
